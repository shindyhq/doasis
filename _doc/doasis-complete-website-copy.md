**Meta Description:** Meet Oluyemisi—a certified counselor and coach creating sacred space for women navigating transitions, grief, and spiritual growth with gentle, grounded support.

### Hero Section

**Headline:**  
*Before I held space for others, I needed someone to hold space for me.*

**Subheadline:**  
And that's exactly why D'Oasis exists.

---

### Section 1: The Story

**Hi, I'm Oluyemisi.**

I'm the woman people instinctively confided in long before I had the certifications to match the calling.

Over shared meals, late-night phone calls, and quiet moments after church, I became the safe space where others could unravel without judgment. Where questions about faith, identity, and belonging could breathe. Where tears were welcomed, not rushed.

But here's what I learned through my own seasons of uncertainty:

**Holding space isn't just about listening—it's about creating room for transformation.**

I've walked through my own wilderness—loss that reshaped me, transitions that terrified me, and the slow, sacred work of becoming someone I didn't know I was allowed to be. Those seasons taught me that healing doesn't follow a linear path. That strength can be soft. That sometimes the bravest thing you can do is ask for help.

So I became certified. I studied trauma-informed care, coaching methodologies, and culturally sensitive practices. I built the frameworks to match the intuition. And I created D'Oasis—a place where women don't have to shrink, perform, or pretend.

**Because you deserve more than surface-level support.**  
You deserve to be witnessed in your wholeness.

---

### Section 2: My Approach

**How I work is as important as *what* I do.**

Every session, every offering, every interaction is rooted in:

**🌿 Faith Integration**  
Your spirituality isn't separate from your healing—it's central to it. I honor your beliefs while creating space for honest questions.

**🌿 Cultural Sensitivity**  
Your identity, background, and lived experience matter. I see you in context, not in isolation.

**🌿 Gentle Accountability**  
Growth requires both compassion and clarity. I'll never push, but I will lovingly challenge you toward your truth.

**🌿 Trauma-Informed Care**  
Safety first, always. Your nervous system, your pace, your boundaries—they guide our work together.

**🌿 Holistic Perspective**  
You're not a problem to fix. You're a whole person navigating a complex season, and every part of you is welcome here.

---

### Section 3: Credentials & Training

**What Qualifies Me to Walk Beside You:**

✓ Certified Professional Life Coach  
✓ Licensed Counselor [*insert state/credentials*]  
✓ Trauma-Informed Care Training  
✓ [Any other relevant certifications—faith-based counseling, grief support, etc.]  
✓ 500+ hours supporting women through transitions, grief, and identity transformation

**But more than credentials, I bring:**  
A lived understanding of what it means to rebuild yourself. A deep respect for your timeline. And an unshakable belief that your healing is not only possible—it's already beginning.

---

### Section 4: Beyond the Sessions

**When I'm not in session, you'll find me:**

- Journaling with my morning coffee, usually asking God big questions
- Creating resources for women who need gentle reminders they're not alone
- Reading everything from theology to poetry to psychology (and finding the threads between them)
- Advocating for mental health awareness in faith communities
- Protecting my own peace as fiercely as I protect my clients' space

**Because I believe this:**  
You can't pour from an empty cup, and healing work requires healers who are also committed to their own restoration.

---

### Section 5: Who This Space Is For

**D'Oasis is for you if:**

- You're navigating a transition that's left you unmoored (divorce, relocation, career shift, empty nest)
- You're grieving something or someone, and the world's timelines don't match yours
- You're questioning beliefs you once held tightly, and you need a safe place to explore
- You're exhausted from performing, and you're ready to discover who you are underneath
- You're a woman of faith who needs support that honors both your spirituality *and* your humanity
- You've tried therapy before, but you're looking for something more holistic and heart-centered

**This space might not be for you if:**

You're seeking quick fixes, cookie-cutter advice, or someone to tell you what to do. My work is collaborative, reflective, and requires your active participation. We'll go at your pace—but we will go deep.

## Section 1: About the Work

### Q: What's the difference between coaching and counseling?

**A:** Great question—and one I get often.

**Counseling** is typically focused on healing past wounds, processing trauma, and working through clinical concerns like anxiety, depression, or grief. It's often covered by insurance and follows specific therapeutic modalities.

**Coaching** is future-focused and action-oriented. It's about clarifying goals, navigating transitions, building skills, and creating alignment between your values and your life. Coaching isn't typically covered by insurance and doesn't diagnose or treat mental health conditions.

**At D'Oasis, I offer both**—and we'll determine together which approach (or blend) serves you best. Sometimes we're doing deep emotional healing (counseling), and sometimes we're strategizing your next chapter (coaching). You get the benefit of both skill sets.

---

### Q: How do I know if we're the right fit?

**A:** The best way to know is to talk. That's why I offer a **free 15-minute consultation**—it's a no-pressure conversation to see if my approach resonates with where you are.

**You'll know we're a fit if:**
- You want support that's grounded in faith but doesn't shy away from hard questions
- You value depth, honesty, and a pace that honors your process
- You're willing to show up and do the work (I'll guide, but you're an active participant)
- You're seeking transformation, not quick fixes

**We might not be a fit if:**
- You're looking for someone to tell you exactly what to do
- You want surface-level advice without deeper exploration
- You're not open to examining beliefs, patterns, or behaviors

Still unsure? **[Book a free consultation]** and we'll figure it out together.

---

### Q: I've tried therapy before and it didn't help. How is this different?

**A:** I hear this a lot, and I'm sorry your previous experience didn't serve you.

Here's what makes D'Oasis different:
- **You're not a diagnosis.** You're a whole person navigating a complex season.
- **We move at your pace.** No rushing, no one-size-fits-all timelines.
- **Faith is integrated, not ignored.** Your spirituality matters here.
- **It's collaborative.** You're the expert on your life; I bring tools, perspective, and witness.
- **We blend modalities.** You get coaching strategy *and* counseling depth, not just one or the other.

If past therapy felt cold, clinical, or like you were just checking boxes—this will feel different. But the only way to know for sure is to experience it.

---

### Q: Do I have to be religious or Christian to work with you?

**A:** Absolutely not.

While my work is *rooted* in faith, I welcome women of all spiritual backgrounds—or none at all. What matters is that you're respected, seen, and supported in whatever belief system (or lack thereof) feels true for you.

If faith is central to your life, we'll honor that. If you're questioning, deconstructing, or exploring, we'll honor that too. And if spirituality isn't part of your journey, we'll focus on what is.

For multi-session packages, one emergency reschedule per package is always honored without penalty.

---

### Q: What if I need to reschedule?

**A:** Simply email me at hello@doasis.com or use the reschedule link in your confirmation email. I'll do my best to find an alternative time that works for both of us.

---

**A:** *(Customize based on your practice)*

**Option 1 (If you don't accept insurance):**  
I do not accept insurance directly. However, I can provide a **superbill** (detailed receipt) that you can submit to your insurance for potential reimbursement if you have out-of-network benefits.

Many clients also use **HSA or FSA cards** to pay for counseling sessions.

**Option 2 (If you do accept insurance):**  
I am in-network with [list insurance providers]. For clients with other insurance, I can provide superbills for out-of-network reimbursement.

---

### Q: Do you offer sliding scale or reduced rates?

**A:** Yes. I reserve **2 spots per month** for clients experiencing financial hardship. If cost is a barrier to getting support, please mention it during your consultation and we'll discuss options.

I also offer limited **scholarship spots** for Restoration Circles.

**My belief:** Everyone deserves access to healing. Let's find a way to make it work.

---

### Q: What payment methods do you accept?

**A:** Credit/debit cards, PayPal, HSA/FSA cards, and payment plans for multi-session packages. Payment is due at the time of booking for single sessions, or before the first session for packages.

---

## Section 4: Confidentiality & Privacy

### Q: Is everything I share confidential?

**A:** Yes. Everything discussed in our sessions is held in strict confidence in accordance with **professional counseling ethics** and **HIPAA regulations** (where applicable).

**The only exceptions** (required by law):
- If there's a risk of harm to yourself or others
- If there's suspected abuse or neglect of a child, elderly person, or dependent adult
- If records are subpoenaed by a court (rare, and I'd notify you)

Otherwise, what you share stays between us.

---

### Q: Are sessions recorded?

**A:** Sessions are **not recorded by me** unless you specifically request it for your own review. If you'd like a recording for reflection purposes, just let me know and I'll enable it (with your written consent).

---

### Q: How is my information stored?

**A:** All client records, notes, and communication are stored securely using HIPAA-compliant, encrypted platforms. I take your privacy seriously.

---

## Section 5: What to Expect

### Q: What should I do to prepare for my first session?

**A:**  
✓ **Find a private, quiet space** where you won't be interrupted  
✓ **Have water nearby** (emotions can be dehydrating!)  
✓ **Give yourself 5-10 minutes before** to ground and breathe  
✓ **Complete any pre-session prompts** I send (if applicable)  
✓ **Show up as you are**—there's no "right" way to do this

Most importantly: **give yourself permission to be honest.** The more real you are, the more transformative our work together will be.

---

### Q: What if I get emotional during a session?

**A:** Please do. Tears, frustration, laughter, silence—all of it is welcome.

Emotions are information, not inconveniences. If feelings come up, we'll move *with* them, not around them. I'll hold space for whatever arises.

And if you need a moment to pause, breathe, or collect yourself—that's completely okay. We move at your pace.

---

### Q: What happens between sessions?

**A:** Depending on your package, you may receive:
- Journal prompts or reflection questions
- Resources (articles, meditations, practices)
- Email or Marco Polo check-ins (for 1:1 clients)
- Access to a private community (for Restoration Circle members)

**You're not alone between sessions.** The work continues, and I'm here to support the integration.

---

### Q: What if I don't know what to talk about?

**A:** That's okay—and actually pretty common.

I'll guide the conversation with questions, reflections, and frameworks. You don't have to have it all figured out or show up with an agenda. Sometimes the most powerful sessions start with "I don't even know where to begin."

Trust the process. I've got you.

---

## Section 6: Specialized Questions

### Q: Do you work with couples?

**A:** Currently, I focus exclusively on **individual work with women**. However, I'm happy to provide referrals to trusted colleagues who specialize in couples or family work.

---

### Q: Do you offer services for men?

**A:** My practice is designed specifically for women, as that's where my training, lived experience, and passion align. I'm happy to refer male clients to excellent practitioners who specialize in men's work.

---

### Q: I'm not in a crisis, but I'm struggling. Is that "enough" to reach out?

**A:** Yes. A thousand times yes.

You don't have to be in crisis to deserve support. You don't have to hit rock bottom to ask for help.

If you're struggling, questioning, navigating a transition, or simply craving deeper alignment—**that's enough.** You're enough.

---

### Q: Can I bring my faith into sessions even if I'm questioning it?

**A:** Absolutely. In fact, those are often the most sacred conversations.

Doubt isn't the opposite of faith—it's part of the journey. You can bring your questions, your anger, your confusion, and your "I don't know what I believe anymore" to our sessions. I'll hold space for all of it.
