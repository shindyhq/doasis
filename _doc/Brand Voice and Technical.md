### Brand Voice Guidelines

**Always:**

- Use gentle, invitational language
- Honor the reader's pace and timing
- Acknowledge the difficulty of seeking help
- Frame growth as collaborative, not prescriptive
- Include both warmth AND professionalism

**Never:**

- Use hustle culture language ("crush your goals")
- Create urgency through scarcity tactics
- Promise quick fixes or overnight transformation
- Use overly corporate or clinical language
- Make assumptions about the reader's faith journey

**Tone Markers:**

- Whispered strength (not shouted confidence)
- Sacred simplicity (not clinical complexity)
- Grounded wisdom (not performative expertise)
