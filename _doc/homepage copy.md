### About Section (Homepage)

**Headline:** *This is your permission to pause.*

In a world that glorifies the grind, D'Oasis is where you come to breathe.

I'm Oluyemisi—a certified counselor and coach who believes transformation happens not in the loud moments, but in the sacred, witnessed ones. 

If you're navigating:
- Grief that won't follow a timeline
- An identity shift that's left you unmoored  
- Questions your faith community can't quite hold
- The exhausting work of unbecoming who you thought you had to be

...then you're in the right place.

Here, we don't rush your healing. We honor it.
