### HIPAA Compliance Checklist

If you're providing counseling (not just coaching), ensure:

☐ Forms are submitted via encrypted platforms  
☐ Data is stored on HIPAA-compliant servers  
☐ You have a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with all vendors  
☐ Access to client data is password-protected and limited  
☐ You have a breach notification protocol  
☐ Clients sign a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices  
☐ You maintain records for required retention period (typically 7 years)

**Note:** Coaching-only practices don't require HIPAA compliance, but it's still best practice for client privacy.

---

### Accessibility Considerations

**Make all forms accessible by:**
- Using clear, simple language (8th-grade reading level)
- Providing alternative formats (phone intake option)
- Including "prefer not to answer" options for sensitive questions
- Allowing text-to-speech compatibility
- Offering assistance for those who need help completing forms
- Keeping forms as brief as possible while gathering necessary info

---

### Red Flags to Watch For in Intake Forms

**Immediate action needed:**
- Current suicidal ideation or self-harm
- Current abuse or domestic violence
- Psychotic symptoms or severe mental health crisis
- Recent hospitalization for mental health

**Action:** Contact client immediately, provide crisis resources, potentially refer to higher level of care

**Proceed with caution:**
- Active substance abuse
- Eating disorder
- Recent trauma (within 6 months)
- Multiple diagnosed mental health conditions
- Currently in therapy (coordinate care)

**Action:** Discuss in consultation/first session, potentially refer to therapist or suggest combined care

---

### Estimated Time to Complete Each Form

- **Initial Contact:** 2-3 minutes
- **Free Consultation Pre-Questionnaire:** 5-10 minutes

---

- Coaching records: 3-5 years after termination (best practice)
- Payment records: 7 years (IRS requirement)
- Signed consent forms: Permanent

**Client rights:**
- Request copy of their records
- Request corrections to inaccurate information
- Request deletion after legal retention period ends

**Secure deletion:**
When deleting records, use secure methods (not just trash/recycle bin)

---

### Client Experience Best Practices

**Make it feel human:**
- Use conversational language in forms
- Explain why you're asking each question
- Thank them for their honesty
- Remind them there are no wrong answers
- Offer support if forms feel overwhelming

**Reduce friction:**
- Mobile-friendly forms
- Save progress feature for long forms
- Pre-fill information when possible
- Send forms in logical sequence (not all at once)
- Provide estimated completion time upfront

**Follow up:**
- Acknowledge form submissions within 24 hours
- Let them know what happens next
- Flag if you need clarification on anything
- Express gratitude for their time and honesty

---

## Final Notes on Forms Strategy

**The goal of intake forms is threefold:**

1. **Gather information** to serve clients well
2. **Establish boundaries** and clear expectations
3. **Create safety** through structure and professionalism

**But remember:**

Forms are a tool, not a replacement for human connection. The most important information will come through in actual conversation.

Keep forms:
- **Clear** (easy to understand)
- **Concise** (as brief as possible while thorough)
- **Compassionate** (honoring vulnerability)
- **Compliant** (legally and ethically sound)

When in doubt, ask yourself: *"Would I want to fill this out if I were seeking support?"*
